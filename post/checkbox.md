# Checkbox

Hi xkcd visitors! Today we released ["Checkbox"](https://xkcd.com/2445"), our yearly April Fool's project. This year was a doozy -- we specced and scrapped several different ideas in the months leading up to today, and only settled on today's concept about 3 days ago. The need to do something simple was a really useful constraint, and we leaned into the idea of making something primitive but deep. I'm really proud of how it turned out!

If you're interested in how this was made, keep an eye on [https://github.com/xkcd](https://github.com/xkcd), where we'll be releasing the source when it's ready. You can also "check" out the comics from previous years there. I'm partial to [Maple](https://github.com/xkcd/maple), our infinite menu system.

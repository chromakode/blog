# Isolated Core

Today I released [Isolated Core](http://chromakode.github.io/isolated-core/), a technique for updating web apps in-page using iframes. I originally developed this technique while working on [Euphoria](https://euphoria.io) because we needed a reliable way to push updates to long-lived clients. It's a simple architecture pattern with a lot of interesting benefits. Try it out and let me know what you think!
